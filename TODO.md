# To-do:

## 26 Oct 2017
* Reflection coefficient and travelling matrices calculations are probably wrong.
  Easiest way to do it is probably to get them from input impedance calculations
* Lossy propagation coefficient calculations should be moved as much as
  possible into `_recalc()` function

# Done

## 26 Oct 2017
* Something still wrong with impedance calculation (getting negative values)

## 17 Oct 2017
* Use reduced impedance in internal calculations
